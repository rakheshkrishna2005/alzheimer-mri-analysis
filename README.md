## 📝 Description

- Alzheimer’s Disease Classifier is a **deep learning application** that uses a **ResNet-50 model** to classify MRI images for Alzheimer's stages.
- Built with **Streamlit** for a user-friendly web interface, the app can classify multiple uploaded MRI images at once.
- Provides **insights** and **treatment recommendations** based on classification.
